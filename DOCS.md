## 1. What the app does

The operator walks a building with the LITHIC PRO V2 device, recording
synchronized LiDAR point clouds + IMU samples (+ optionally thermal
images) into rosbag files. Each "scan" produces a folder of 30-second
bag chunks plus a `scan_info.json` metadata file. The collected data is
later copied to a USB drive for processing on a workstation.

The GUI is a kiosk: it auto-launches on boot, fills the screen, and only
exposes the operations a non-technical operator needs:

- **Home** — at-a-glance device + storage + last-scan summary.
- **Scan** — set up a new scan (site / floor / part / in-charge) and run it.
- **Runs** — read-only browser of previous scans.
- **Data Transfer** — copy scans to USB, delete old ones.
- **Menu** — storage, theme, supervisor-locked admin actions.

Everything that could damage data (delete a scan, change device ID,
toggle DEV mode, edit CSVs) is locked behind a supervisor PIN.

```

Key architectural choices:

- **One Python GUI process**, spawning ROS as a subprocess via the system
  shell. The GUI does not link to roscpp or hold any ROS state itself —
  if a driver crashes, only that subprocess dies.
- **Persistent `roscore`** owned by the GUI (via `setsid`) so killing
  `roslaunch` between scans doesn't take the master down with it.
- **All driver / rosbag processes** are pinned to specific cores
  (`taskset`) and run at SCHED_FIFO priority 50 (`chrt -f`). The Python
  GUI itself runs at default priority on whatever core the kernel picks.
- **Recording is rosbag's responsibility, not Python's.** We never read
  driver messages in Python and write them to disk — that would couple
  Python's GIL into the sensor read path. Python only observes that
  bags are appearing on disk and that the driver nodes are still in
  `rosnode list`.

## 3. Process model

| Process | Spawned by | Purpose | Survives what |
|---|---|---|---|
| `python3 App/main.py` | `run.sh` (from `.desktop`) | The GUI itself | Reboot via autostart |
| `roscore` (`rosmaster` + `rosout`) | `RosController._ensure_roscore` via `setsid` | ROS master | `roslaunch` death, individual scans |
| `roslaunch` + ROS nodes | `RosController.launch()` | Drivers + recorder | Tied to a single scan; killed on Stop |
| `setup-system.sh`-installed systemd units | systemd | One-shot config (CPU governor) and timer (log prune) | Not relevant per-scan |

Inside the GUI process, the relevant threads:

- **Qt main thread** — event loop, all widget updates.
- **`_launch_worker`** (`core/ros_controller.py`) — spawned per scan by
  `launch()`. Does the slow part of starting a scan (roscore bring-up,
  `roslaunch` spawn, spin-thread settle, OOM-protect kickoff) so the
  Start tap never freezes the GUI. `is_running()` reports True while it
  runs (`_launching`); its side effects are generation-guarded against
  `stop()` via `_llock` (see §5).
- **`_ROSSpinThread`** (`core/ros_controller.py`) — only active when the
  app needs to subscribe to image topics (currently no-op because
  `config.VIEW_TOPIC` is empty).
- **`_NodeMonitor._loop`** (`core/ros_controller.py`) — polls
  `rosnode list` every 5 s for driver liveness.
- **`_monitor_proc`** (`core/ros_controller.py`) — watches the
  `roslaunch` subprocess; fires `launch_died` if it exits unexpectedly.
- **`_run_ros_stop`** (`gui/scan_player.py`) — spawned for each Stop
  click so `ros.stop()` doesn't block the GUI thread.
- **`_oom_protect_drivers`** (`core/ros_controller.py`) — short-lived,
  finds driver PIDs after launch and sudo-invokes the OOM helper.
- **`DeviceMonitor`** worker thread — runs the readiness probes
  (lsusb, ping, open `/dev/ttyUSB0`); paused during scans.
- **`QAWorker`** uses `QTimer` callbacks on the main thread plus a
  `QFileSystemWatcher` for bag-rotation events; no extra thread.
- **`_CopyWorker`** (`gui/scan_list.py`) — `QThread` doing file copy
  while the modal progress dialog keeps the UI responsive.

## 5. Per-file reference

### `App/main.py` (268 lines)

- Inserts the `App/` directory onto `sys.path` so `import config` works.
- Single-instance guard via `QLocalServer` / `QLocalSocket` so
  double-clicking the launcher twice doesn't spawn two GUIs.
- `_SplashScreen` — frameless full-screen splash with fade-in /
  fade-out via `QGraphicsOpacityEffect` + `QPropertyAnimation`.
- `_apply_palette()` — pins every `QPalette` role to a value from
  `gui.theme.P` so the OS palette doesn't leak through transparent
  widgets.
- Imports the heavy modules (`MainWindow`, ROS controller) AFTER the
  splash is shown, so the user sees the brand within ~100 ms.

### `App/config.py`

See [§6 Configuration reference](#6-configuration-reference-appconfigpy).

### `App/core/audit.py` (77 lines)

Append-only JSONL action log at `App/data/action_log.jsonl`. Public API:

```python
log_action('scan_started', site='Site A', folder='/media/.../dumps/...')
log_action('scan_stopped', folder='...')
log_action('dev_mode_toggled', new_value=True)
read_actions(n=200)   # newest first
read_recent(n=100)    # chronological (back-compat)
log_path()            # absolute path of the log
```

Every write is best-effort — wrapped in `try/except` so a full disk
never blocks a scan. One JSON object per line so a half-written line
doesn't invalidate earlier entries.

Surfaces in the GUI through `Settings → Supervisor → View Action Log`.

### `App/core/qa_worker.py` (308 lines)

Real-time quality monitoring during a scan. Three independent checks:

1. **Watchdog** (every 10 s): `ros.driver_live(<key>)` for each entry
   in `cfg.DRIVERS` (including the watchdog-only `rosbag` recorder).
   Tracks `_driver_fail_n` per driver; for a driver that was up and then
   disappears, auto-terminates after `DEBOUNCE_TICKS` (2) consecutive
   DEAD ticks. For a driver that never comes up, auto-terminates once
   `NEVER_STARTED_TIMEOUT_S` (30 s) elapses. Seek is the only driver
   excluded from termination; every non-seek driver — sensors and the
   recorder alike — is fatal.
2. **Disk** (every 10 s): checks both `cfg.DUMP_PATH` and `/`.
   Terminates if either drops below its threshold (`MIN_DISK_GB` for
   data drive, hardcoded 1.5 GB for `/`).
3. **Per-bag** (event-driven via `QFileSystemWatcher`): when a `.bag`
   appears in the scan folder, opens it with `rosbag.Bag()`, computes
   per-topic counts, classifies each driver as OK / WARN / LOW / MISSING
   against `cfg.DRIVERS[driver][topic]` thresholds (with slack from
   `cfg.BUFFER`). Terminates with a multi-line reason listing offenders.

See [§9 QA system](#9-qa-system) for the status ladder.

Signals:

- `log(message, level)` — routed through the player's console.
- `terminate(reason)` — handled by the player's `_on_qa_terminate`,
  which auto-stops and pops the alert overlay.
- `bag_checked(results)` — currently unused on the receiver side
  (the player builds its own per-bag display in `_check_bag_rotation`).

### `App/core/ros_controller.py` (835 lines)

Encapsulates everything ROS-related so the GUI never imports rospy
directly. Public surface:

```python
ros = RosController()
ros.frame_received.connect(slot)   # signal(topic: str, image: QImage)
ros.launch_died.connect(slot)
ros.log.connect(slot)              # signal(msg, level)

ros.launch(launch_file, args, metadata=...)   # ASYNC — returns immediately
ros.subscribe(topic, msg_type)     # no-op shim
ros.stop()                         # synchronous; caller should wrap in thread
ros.app_log(msg)                   # tee to <scan_folder>/app.log
ros.is_running()                   # True while launching OR roslaunch alive
ros.driver_live(driver_key)        # bool: rosnode list contains the driver's node
RosController.shutdown_roscore()   # class method, called at app exit
```

`launch()` is **asynchronous**: it does the fast prep (scan-folder
paths, app.log header, command string), sets `_launching = True`, bumps
`_launch_gen`, and hands the rest to a `_launch_worker` daemon thread.
The worker brings up roscore (up to ~10 s on a cold boot), spawns
`roslaunch`, starts the process monitor + `_NodeMonitor`, settles 3 s,
then starts the spin thread and OOM-protect worker. The GUI never
blocks on Start.

Concurrency contract with `stop()` (the part that makes the async safe):

- **`is_running()` counts `_launching` as alive**, so the QA watchdog's
  "roslaunch process died" check can't fire during the bring-up window.
- **`stop()` bumps `_launch_gen` under `_llock`**; every side-effecting
  block in the worker re-checks the gen *inside* the same lock before
  acting (spawn roslaunch, start `_NodeMonitor`, publish + start the
  spin thread). Result: each worker side effect either completed before
  the bump (and stop()'s teardown cleans it up) or never happens. An
  operator stopping 2 s after starting aborts the launch cleanly.
- The lock is held only for microsecond-scale operations — never across
  the 3-s settle, joins, or roscore wait — so it cannot deadlock.
- The spin thread is built on a local and published to `self._thread`
  only under the lock (it's created on the worker thread, so it has no
  QObject parent — Qt forbids cross-thread parenting).

Internal pieces:

- **`_ROSSpinThread`** — QThread that initialises `rospy` and subscribes
  to any `cfg.VIEW_TOPIC`. Currently no-op because thermal preview is
  off. Designed to NEVER call `rospy.signal_shutdown()` between scans
  (rospy is one-way: once shut down, the next `init_node` is permanent
  garbage).
- **`_NodeMonitor`** — background thread that runs
  `bash -c 'source setup.bash && rosnode list'` every 5 s, parses the
  output, and serves `is_live(node_name)` queries.
  Polling interval was tuned to balance "feedback to operator" vs
  "every probe forks a bash + sources a 1 MB setup.bash + opens an
  XML-RPC socket, which leaks into the IMU read loop at 1 Hz". 5 s is
  the sweet spot we measured.
- **`_ensure_roscore`** — starts a persistent `roscore` in its own
  process group (`os.setsid`) so killing `roslaunch` later doesn't
  take it down. Cached at class level so a single instance is shared.
- **`shutdown_roscore`** — class method called at app exit
  (`atexit` in `main.py`) that kills the persistent master.
- **`_oom_protect_drivers`** — background worker that tails the
  roslaunch session log (`~/.ros/log/latest/roslaunch-*.log`) for
  `process[<name>-N]: started with pid [Y]` lines, forwards them to the
  on-screen console, and pushes the PIDs of data-critical processes
  (`hesai_ros_driver_node`, `xsens_mti_node`, `rosbag_record`) through
  `sudo /usr/local/sbin/lithic-oom-protect <pids>`.
- **`_cleanup_ros`** — per-scan teardown: `rosnode kill` everything not
  on the keep list, then a belt-and-braces
  `killall roslaunch hesai_ros_driver_node seek_driver xsens_mti_node
  record`. `record` (the actual binary name of the rosbag recorder) is
  on the list because a straggler recorder keeps the `.bag.active`
  open and corrupts its tail.

### `App/gui/main_window.py` (495 lines)

The shell window: frameless, fullscreen, contains:

- **Title bar** — gradient brand label (`_GradientLabel` paints with
  `QLinearGradient`), live clock, and three round buttons: OSK toggle
  (⌨ pokes squeekboard via `gui/osk.py`), minimize, close.
- **Sidebar** (`_NavButton` × 5: Home, Scan, Runs, Data Transfer, Menu),
  plus a **Shutdown button** (⏻) above the device chip — confirm-gated
  `systemctl poweroff`, refused while a scan is running. It exists
  because pulling power without a clean shutdown has corrupted the SSD
  before, and the kiosk exposes no terminal.
- **Content stack** — `QStackedWidget` of the five pages.
- **Footer** — scan indicator (left) + disk free/usage bar (right).
- **Disk poll** — `QTimer` every 5 s refreshes the footer's
  `<scan_state> · Primary X GB free · External Y GB free` row.
- **Scan-state wiring** — `scan_page.scan_state_changed` drives the nav
  lockout (only the Scan tab is clickable mid-scan) AND
  `home_page.set_scan_active`, which pauses Home's periodic dumps-tree
  walk while recording.

Also re-exports every theme constant (`BG`, `PRIMARY`, …) from
`gui.theme.P` so the rest of the codebase can keep
`from gui.main_window import …` imports unchanged after a theme switch.

`_GradientLabel` and `_NavButton` are reused across multiple pages.

### `App/gui/theme.py` (129 lines)

The two palettes (LIGHT, DARK) as plain dicts; the active one is
selected at import time based on `App/data/theme.json`.

`apply()` writes the selected key back to the JSON file. The Settings
page calls this and prompts the user to restart — a hot theme swap is
deliberately not supported (it would require rebuilding every already-
constructed widget for marginal value on a kiosk).

### `App/gui/device_status.py` (446 lines)

Two classes:

- **`DeviceMonitor`** (singleton, `instance()` classmethod) — the only
  code that actually probes the hardware. Owns one `QTimer` ticking at
  5 s and a worker thread that runs the probes (lsusb, ping, open
  `/dev/ttyUSB0` and look for the Xsens preamble `0xFA 0xFF`).
  `pause()` / `resume()` methods are called by `ScanPlayerPage`
  around a scan so the IMU probe doesn't steal UART bytes from
  `xsens_mti_node`.
- **`DeviceStatusPanel`** — the visual chip row. Subscribed to
  `DeviceMonitor.results_changed`. Used twice: as a banner on Home,
  and as the sidebar on Scan Setup.

The XsensIMU probe was the **smoking gun** for an ~50-msgs/30s IMU
drop during scans: Linux lets two processes share a TTY, so each
5-second probe stole a fraction of a second's worth of IMU bytes from
the driver. Pausing during scans fixed it completely.

### `App/gui/scan_setup.py` (543 lines)

The form before a scan starts. Fields:

- **Site** (combo + completer, loaded from `App/data/sites.csv`)
- **Floor type** (Ground Floor / Floor / Basement)
- **Floor number** (`QSpinBox` with custom +/- icons)
- **Scan part** (`QLineEdit`)
- **In-charge** (combo from `App/data/incharge.csv`)

`scan_requested(metadata: dict)` signal feeds `ScanPage`, which
switches to the player.

Includes a `DeviceStatusPanel` in its right sidebar so the operator
sees readiness while filling out the form.

### `App/gui/scan_player.py` (1616 lines — the biggest file)

Live scan view. Owns:

- The ROS controller (`self.ros = RosController()`)
- The QA worker (`self.qa = QAWorker(self)`)
- An inotify watcher for the scan folder (`QFileSystemWatcher`)
- Timers: `_elapsed_timer` (1 s) for the duration label,
  `_pill_timer` (1 s) for LiDAR/IMU LIVE/DEAD pills
- The console widget (rich-text QTextEdit, monospaced)

Watchdog-only drivers (entries in `cfg.DRIVERS` with an empty topics
dict, i.e. `rosbag`) are skipped in all three visual loops — the device
pill grid, the status-card sensor rows, and the per-bag console block.
They aren't sensors; the QA watchdog still monitors them and raises the
alert overlay if they die.

Lifecycle methods:

- `begin(metadata)` — resets UI, called when the user clicks "Start Scan"
  on Scan Setup.
- `_start_scan()` — pauses DeviceMonitor → resets bag tracking →
  subscribes view topics (no-op here) → `ros.launch(...)` (async —
  returns immediately, roscore + roslaunch start on a worker thread) →
  starts inotify watch + elapsed timer + pill timer + QA worker → shows
  the startup-guidance overlay → arms the 60-s no-bag tripwire
  (`_check_first_bag_appeared`, generation-guarded).
- `_stop_scan(after=...)` — sets stopping flag, freezes the recording
  UI immediately (stops `_elapsed_timer`, kills the pulsing dot,
  resets pills), spawns a daemon thread for `ros.stop()`, shows the
  `_StoppingOverlay`, schedules a 30 s deadline (generation-guarded,
  so a deadline armed by a previous Stop can never fire against a
  later one).
- `_finish_stop()` — queued-connected to `_ros_stop_done`. Hides
  stopping overlay, sets buttons back, resumes DeviceMonitor,
  writes scan_info.json, fires the after-stop callback.
- `_check_first_bag_appeared(gen)` — one-shot 60 s after Start: if the
  scan folder still has zero `.bag` / `.bag.active` files, the recorder
  is alive but not writing (wrong data_path, read-only disk, silent
  rosbag failure) — auto-terminates with a clear reason.
- `_auto_terminate(reason)` — used by QA and bag-corruption checks.
  Stops the scan + shows `_AlertOverlay` with the reason.

Overlays (all inner classes in this file):

- `_OverlayConfirm` — "Scan in progress, stop and continue?" yes/no.
- `_StoppingOverlay` — "Stopping and saving scan…" animated dots.
- `_AlertOverlay` — title + reason + OK button, monospaced body so QA
  bullets line up.
- `_StartupGuide` — 3-phase guidance (STAY STILL 45 s → ROTATE 15 s →
  START MOVING 5 s) with auto fade-out.

Bag rotation: handled by `_check_bag_rotation` via inotify. On each
`.bag.active → .bag` rename, opens the just-closed bag with
`rosbag.Bag()` for the authoritative per-topic count. If
`rosbag.Bag()` raises (corrupt index), logs ERROR and auto-terminates
immediately — see [§9 QA system](#9-qa-system).

### `App/gui/scan_list.py` (1453 lines)

Reusable list widget used by Runs and Data Transfer pages, plus all the
copy/delete/recovery machinery:

- **`ScanListWidget`** — checkable rows, search, sort, drag-scroll.
- **`copy_scans_with_dialog(scans, dest, parent)`** — public entry for
  copy. Pre-flight free-space check, `_CopyWorker` QThread, modal
  `_CopyDialog`.
- **`_CopyWorker`** — the actual copy. Per-file `.part` sidecar +
  `fsync` + size verify + atomic `os.replace`; per-scan post-walk
  source/destination diff; global `os.sync()` at end.
- **`delete_scans_with_confirm(scans, parent)`** — public entry for
  delete. Uses `_force_remove_tree` which tries `shutil.rmtree`,
  falls back to `chmod -R u+w` + `rm -rf` to survive `ntfs3` dirent
  corruption.
- **`_recover_orphan(orphan)`** — called from the orphan-recovery
  dialog. First runs `_release_stale_rosbag_locks` to kill any straggler
  ROS processes and rename leftover `.bag.active` files to `.bag`, then
  writes a `scan_info.json` marking the scan as `recovered: true`.
- **`offer_orphan_recovery(parent, dumps_root)`** — opens the recovery
  dialog if `find_orphan_scans` finds anything. Called once at startup
  from `MainWindow`.

### `App/gui/scan_stats.py` (382 lines)

Pure functions, no Qt:

- `list_scans(root)` — walk for `scan_info.json` files, attach
  computed size/duration, return newest-first.
- `find_orphan_scans(root)` — folders with `.bag` files but no valid
  `scan_info.json`.
- `parse_scan_folder_name(name)` — reverse the canonical folder name
  produced by `_make_scan_folder` (site + floor + part + timestamp).
- `format_size(n)` / `format_duration(seconds)` — human strings.
- `estimate_gb_per_hour(scans)` — average of non-recovered scans,
  filtered to plausible per-scan rates `[10, 200] GB/h`.
- `estimate_hours_remaining(free_bytes, gb_per_hour)`.
- `find_external_mount()` / `find_all_external_mounts()` — USB
  detection across `/media`, `/run/media`, `/mnt`.
- `ensure_external_drives_mounted()` — fallback automount: finds
  unmounted USB partitions via `lsblk`, clears stale empty mount dirs,
  and `udisksctl mount`s each candidate. Called by the Data Transfer
  page before each refresh. Note: runs on the GUI thread; a slow NTFS
  mount can stall the UI for up to ~10 s per partition.

### `App/gui/home.py` (180 lines)

Three top cards (Device / Last Scan / Storage Free) + `DeviceStatusPanel`
banner + a big "Start a New Scan" CTA that jumps to the Scan page.
Auto-refreshes every 10 s — **paused while a scan is recording**
(`set_scan_active`, wired from `scan_state_changed` in MainWindow):
the refresh walks the entire dumps tree and stats every file, which
would otherwise compete with rosbag's writes on the same disk every
10 s, page visibility notwithstanding (QTimers fire regardless of
which page is shown).

### `App/gui/runs.py` (71 lines)

Thin wrapper: a `_GradientLabel` title, a refresh button, a total
size readout, and a non-selectable `ScanListWidget`.

### `App/gui/data_transfer.py` (327 lines)

An "External Drive" status card on top (detects USB mounts via
`ensure_external_drives_mounted` + `find_external_mount`), then a
selectable `ScanListWidget` of scans below, with Copy / Delete /
Refresh / Eject buttons. There is **no periodic polling** — the card
refreshes on page entry (`showEvent` / `on_show`) and on the Detect
button. Eject is run on a daemon thread (so the GUI doesn't freeze
during sync) and reports success/failure via the queued
`_eject_done` signal. The mount/detect path, by contrast, runs on the
GUI thread (see `ensure_external_drives_mounted` note above).

### `App/gui/settings_page.py` (375 lines)

Three cards in a scroll area:

- **Storage** — recording location (read-only, mirrors `cfg.DUMP_PATH`).
- **Appearance** — Light / Dark toggle (writes via `gui.theme.apply`).
- **Supervisor** — locked actions: Change PIN, Edit Device ID, Toggle
  DEV mode, Manage Sites/In-charge CSVs, View Action Log. Each tile
  calls `supervisor.ensure_unlocked(self)` before opening its dialog.

### `App/gui/supervisor.py` (103 lines)

- Stores PIN as `(salt, pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', pin, salt, 100_000))` in
  `App/data/supervisor.json`. Default PIN is `0000`.
- `verify(pin)` — constant-time `hmac.compare_digest`; updates
  `_unlock_until` to `now + 10 min` on success.
- `is_unlocked()` / `lock()` / `ensure_unlocked(parent)` — gate every
  admin action behind a 10-minute window so a single PIN entry covers a
  short admin session.

### `App/gui/supervisor_dialog.py` (134 lines)

Frameless modal PIN entry dialog. Numeric keypad + dotted display.

### `App/gui/supervisor_tools.py` (423 lines)

The admin dialogs themselves:

- **`_ChangePinDialog`** — old pin / new / confirm.
- **`_DeviceIdDialog`** — edits `cfg.DEVICE` and writes back to
  `config.py` (atomic write via `patch_config_py`).
- **`_DevModeDialog`** — toggles `cfg.DEV_MODE`, same atomic writer.
- **`_CsvManagerDialog`** — edit Sites / In-charge CSVs in-place.
- **`_ActionLogDialog`** — paginated read of `action_log.jsonl`.

### `App/gui/osk.py` (136 lines)

On-screen-keyboard helper for the touch kiosk. Listens for
`QApplication.focusChanged`; when an editable widget gains focus it
shows RPi OS's bundled `squeekboard` via its `sm.puri.OSK0` DBus
interface (`gdbus call … SetVisible`), and hides it (debounced) when
focus leaves. Installed once in `main.py` as `app._osk`; the title-bar
⌨ button calls its `toggle()`. Degrades silently if `gdbus` or
squeekboard is missing — `[osk]` lines in
`/tmp/lithic-app-launch.log` show what it's doing.

### `App/gui/make_icon.py` (95 lines)

Tool, not part of the runtime. Generates `Images/2739025.png` from the
brand glyph. Run manually if the launcher icon needs to be rebuilt.

## 6. Configuration reference (`App/config.py`)

Every operator-or-device-specific value lives here. Other modules
`import config as cfg` and read attributes off it. Changes can be made
two ways:

1. **Edit the file directly** (requires app restart).
2. **Through the GUI's supervisor tools**, which use
   `config.patch_config_py(key, value)` to do an atomic rewrite (tmp +
   fsync + rename) — only supports `device_id` and `dev_mode`.

### Top-level switches

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DEV_MODE` | `False` | If True, app runs with mock data and no real hardware. UI is identical; QA worker auto-passes; DeviceMonitor reports all green. |
| `VERSION` | `'1.1.2'` | Single source of truth for the app version. Surfaced via `QCoreApplication.setApplicationVersion()` in `main.py`. Bump here on release. |
| `DEVICE` | `'LITHIC_PRO_V2'` | Device identifier, embedded in bag filenames and scan_info.json. |

### ROS workspace

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SETUP_BASH` | `~/catkin_hesai_ros2/devel/setup.bash` | Sourced before any subprocess that talks to ROS. |
| `LAUNCH_FILE` | `~/catkin_hesai_ros2/lidar_imu_record.launch` | Passed to `roslaunch`. |

### Drivers

```python
DRIVERS = {
    'hesai':  {'/hesai/pandar': 595},     # 20 Hz × 30 s
    'xsens':  {'/imu/data':    5990},     # 200 Hz × 30 s
    'rosbag': {},                         # watchdog-only (no source topic)
}
```

Each top-level key is a driver. Each inner dict maps topic → expected
message count per 30-s bag. `QAWorker._check_bag` compares actual counts
against these to produce OK/WARN/LOW/MISSING status.

The `rosbag` entry is a **watchdog-only** driver: its empty dict means
the per-bag count check skips it, but the node-liveness watchdog still
runs against `DRIVER_NODES['rosbag']` (`/rosbag_record`). rosbag has no
source topic of its own — its silence means recording isn't happening,
so if its node dies (or never comes up within 30 s) the scan is
auto-terminated with a "Recorder died / never started" alert. It is not
a sensor, so it is deliberately excluded from the LiDAR/IMU readiness
pills and the per-bag console block in the player.

To re-enable Seek, uncomment the `'seek'` entry here AND the
corresponding `BUFFER['seek']` AND the `DRIVER_NODES['seek']` entry.

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DRIVERS` | Topic counts QA expects per 30-s bag. Empty dict = watchdog-only (node liveness, no count check). |
| `BUFFER` | Per-driver slack subtracted from threshold for WARN classification. `lidar=20, imu=50`. |
| `DRIVER_NODES` | Driver key → expected ROS node name shown in `rosnode list`. |
| `VIEW_TOPIC` | Live-video subscriptions for the player. Empty (no live preview without thermal). |

### Hardware-readiness probes

| Key | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `LIDAR_IP` | `192.168.1.201` | `_probe_lidar` (ICMP ping) |
| `LIDAR_HOST_IP` | `192.168.1.23` | (optional) — set `''` to skip the NIC-IP sanity check |
| `SEEK_USB_VID` | `289d` | `_probe_seek` (lsusb match) |
| `XSENS_FTDI_VID` | `0403` | `_probe_xsens_imu` (lsusb match) |
| `XSENS_FTDI_PID` | `6001` | same |
| `XSENS_SERIAL_PORT` | `/dev/ttyUSB0` | open() + read 1 KB looking for `0xFA 0xFF` |
| `XSENS_SERIAL_BAUD` | `2000000` | |

### Storage + QA

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DUMP_PATH` | `/media/cm5-v1/DATA` | Root of all scan data. The `dumps/<month>/<DD_MMM>/<scan>/` tree lives under this. |
| `MIN_DISK_GB` | `5` | QA terminates scans below this on the data drive. |
| `DISPLAY_RESOLUTION` | `None` | Force a kiosk resolution, e.g. `(1920, 1080)`. `None` = native. |

### Pick-list CSVs

| Key | Path | Editor |
|---|---|---|
| `DATA_DIR` | `App/data/` | — |
| `SITES_CSV` | `App/data/sites.csv` | Supervisor → Manage Sites |
| `INCHARGE_CSV` | `App/data/incharge.csv` | Supervisor → Manage In-charge |

### Atomic config patcher

```python
config.patch_config_py('device_id', 'LITHIC_PRO_V3')   # rewrites config.py
config.patch_config_py('dev_mode',  True)
```

Uses regex on the source file with `count=1` so it only edits the
canonical assignment, then writes via tmp + fsync + os.replace.

## 7. UI walkthrough — page by page

### Home

The default landing page. Three top cards:

- **Device** — `cfg.DEVICE` + a brief description.
- **Last Scan** — site / when / size of the most recent `scan_info.json`.
- **Storage Free** — free bytes on `cfg.DUMP_PATH`, plus an estimated
  "≈ N hours of scan time" computed from `estimate_gb_per_hour` of
  past scans (fallback `DEFAULT_GB_PER_HOUR = 60`).

Below the cards: a horizontal `DeviceStatusPanel` showing live LiDAR /
IMU readiness.

A big primary "Start a New Scan" button jumps to the Scan page.

Refreshes every 10 s. The refresh is paused while a scan is recording —
it walks the whole dumps tree, which would contend with rosbag's writes
on the data drive — and resumes (with an immediate refresh) on Stop.

### Scan (sub-stack: Setup → Player)

`ScanPage` is just a `QStackedWidget` of `ScanSetupPage` and
`ScanPlayerPage`. The setup form emits `scan_requested(metadata)` →
the player calls `begin(metadata)` and the stack flips.

When the operator clicks "Next Scan" on the player after a scan ends,
the page flips back to a freshly-reset setup form.

#### Setup
Form fields (Site / Floor type / Floor number / Scan part / In-charge)
with custom widgets:

- Site + In-charge are autocomplete combos backed by CSVs.
- Floor number is a `QSpinBox` with custom +/- icons painted as lines
  in `_step_glyph` (so the symbols are pixel-aligned regardless of
  font metrics).
- The right column is a `DeviceStatusPanel` so the operator sees
  hardware readiness while filling out the form.

The Start button is disabled until all required fields are valid.

#### Player
Documented in detail in [§8](#8-scan-lifecycle-the-core-flow).

### Runs

Read-only list of past scans (anything under
`<DUMP_PATH>/dumps/**/scan_info.json`). Per-row: site / when / duration
/ size / driver list. Click → details popup with bag count and per-topic
totals. No mutation buttons — the only actions on this page are
refresh and view.

### Data Transfer

- **External drive card** at top: shows the currently-mounted USB drive
  (path, label, free space) or "Plug in a USB drive to copy scans."
  Refreshed on page entry and via the Detect button (no periodic
  polling); Detect also runs the `ensure_external_drives_mounted`
  fallback automount for drives that pcmanfm/udisks missed.
- **Eject button** runs `udisksctl unmount/power-off` on a daemon
  thread; result reported back via `_eject_done` signal.
- **Scan list** below: selectable rows.
- **Copy / Delete / Refresh** buttons. Copy is enabled only when both
  ≥ 1 scan is selected AND a USB drive is mounted with enough free
  space.

### Menu

Three cards:

- **Storage** — read-only display of `cfg.DUMP_PATH` and `MIN_DISK_GB`.
- **Appearance** — Light/Dark toggle. Writes via `gui.theme.apply` and
  shows a "Restart the app for the new theme" prompt.
- **Supervisor** — five locked actions. Clicking any of them runs
  `supervisor.ensure_unlocked(self)`; if not unlocked, opens
  `_PinDialog`. Successful unlock keeps the session admin for 10 min.

## 9. QA system

Lives in `core/qa_worker.py`. Started by the player in `_start_scan`,
stopped in `_stop_scan`. Three concurrent checks:

### 9.1 Watchdog (10 s tick)

For each driver in `cfg.DRIVERS` (sensors plus the watchdog-only
`rosbag` recorder):

```python
alive = ros.driver_live(driver_key)
if alive:
    _driver_ever_up[driver] = True
    _driver_fail_n[driver]  = 0
elif not _driver_ever_up[driver]:
    # never came up yet — give it NEVER_STARTED_TIMEOUT_S to appear
    if elapsed > NEVER_STARTED_TIMEOUT_S:          # 30 s
        terminate.emit(f'{label} never started …')  # unless seek
else:
    # was up, now gone — debounce a transient rosnode hiccup
    _driver_fail_n[driver] += 1
    if _driver_fail_n[driver] >= DEBOUNCE_TICKS:   # 2 ticks ≈ 20 s
        terminate.emit(f'{label} died …')           # unless seek
```

Two consecutive DEAD ticks (~20 s) terminate a driver that had been
alive; a driver that never appears within 30 s of `start()` terminates
immediately. The recorder gets distinct phrasing — "Recorder never
started — no bags will be written" / "Recorder died — recording has
stopped" — so the alert overlay is unambiguous. Seek is the only driver
excluded from termination.

### 9.2 Disk (10 s tick)

```python
free_data = shutil.disk_usage(cfg.DUMP_PATH).free / 1e9
if free_data < cfg.MIN_DISK_GB:
    terminate.emit(f'Disk space critical on data drive: {free_data:.1f} GB free')

free_root = shutil.disk_usage('/').free / 1e9
if free_root < 1.5:
    terminate.emit(f'Root filesystem critical: ... Stopping before OS becomes unresponsive.')
```

Root-FS check was added after a 20-min scan filled the SD card to 99%
and locked up the whole OS. The kernel can't even allocate memory or
fork bash when `/` is full.

### 9.3 Per-bag (event-driven via QFileSystemWatcher)

On every `.bag` created in the scan folder:

```python
counts = {topic: rosbag.Bag(path).get_type_and_topic_info()...}
for driver, topics in cfg.DRIVERS.items():
    for topic, threshold in topics.items():
        buf = BUFFER[driver_key]
        count = counts.get(topic, 0)
        if count >= threshold:           → OK
        elif count >= threshold - buf:   → WARN     (close but acceptable)
        elif count > 0:                  → LOW      (terminate from bag 1+)
        else:                            → MISSING  (terminate always)
```

Termination rules:
- **Seek topics never terminate.**
- **MISSING** (count = 0) is fatal on any non-seek topic, even on bag 0
  (the first 30-s bag).
- **LOW** is fatal only from bag 1 onward — bag 0 is partial because
  recording starts mid-second so a small shortfall is expected.

The terminate reason now lists each offender with `count/threshold
[status]`, so the alert overlay reads e.g.:

```
Bag 3 QA failed — data below threshold:
  • LiDAR 543/600 [LOW]
  • IMU 4,820/6,000 [LOW]
```

### 9.4 Per-bag corruption check (in `scan_player.py`)

Independent of QAWorker. `_read_bag_topic_counts` is called from
`_check_bag_rotation` on each `.bag.active → .bag` rename. If
`rosbag.Bag()` raises (corrupt index, truncated file), the player
immediately calls `_auto_terminate(...)`. No streak required — one
bad bag terminates the scan, because by the time you see one,
recording integrity is already gone.

### 9.5 No-bag tripwire — 60 s (in `scan_player.py`)

Also independent of QAWorker. `_start_scan` arms a one-shot
`QTimer.singleShot(60 s, _check_first_bag_appeared)`. If the scan
folder still contains **zero** `.bag` / `.bag.active` files at that
point, recording never started on disk — the recorder node may be
alive (so the watchdog is happy) but writing nowhere: wrong
`data_path` arg, read-only filesystem, or a silent rosbag failure.
The scan is auto-terminated with a reason pointing at disk health
and the data path.

The callback captures `_stop_generation` when armed and bails if it no
longer matches, so a tripwire from a stopped scan can never kill a
subsequent one. Note the 60-s mark lands while the `_StartupGuide`
overlay (65 s total) is still up — the alert overlay simply stacks
above it.

Together the four checks cover the failure matrix: drivers dead →
watchdog (9.1); disk full → 9.2; data thin/missing → 9.3; bags corrupt
→ 9.4; recorder writing nothing at all → 9.5.

## 10. Device readiness monitor

`gui/device_status.py`. Singleton `DeviceMonitor.instance()`. Probes:

| Device | Probe |
|---|---|
| LiDAR | `subprocess.run(['ping', '-c', '1', '-W', '1', LIDAR_IP])` |
| IMU | `lsusb` looking for `XSENS_FTDI_VID:XSENS_FTDI_PID` AND open `XSENS_SERIAL_PORT` at `XSENS_SERIAL_BAUD`, read up to 1 KB, look for `0xFA 0xFF` preamble in the buffer |
| Thermal | `lsusb` looking for `SEEK_USB_VID:*` (when enabled) |

Why both lsusb AND open the port for IMU: the FTDI cable stays
enumerated even when the IMU is unpowered, so lsusb alone gives a
false positive. Reading actual bytes from the port confirms the
sensor is on.

### Pause / resume

The IMU probe opens `/dev/ttyUSB0` for ~1 second every 5 seconds.
Linux allows two processes to share a TTY, splitting the byte stream
between them. With `xsens_mti_node` already reading the port, our
probe steals ~9 IMU messages per invocation. Six probes per 30-s bag
= ~54 lost samples — exactly the symptom that took us a day to diagnose.

`pause()` is called by the player at `_start_scan`, blocks briefly
(up to 2 s) for any in-flight probe to finish, then stops the timer.
`resume()` is called from `_finish_stop` once the driver has fully
released the port.

## 11. Data integrity — delete / copy / recovery

### 11.1 Delete

`delete_scans_with_confirm` (and the single-folder variant in
`scan_list.py`) routes through **`_force_remove_tree(path)`**:

```
1. shutil.rmtree(path)        ← fast path for clean trees
2. if dir still exists:
       chmod -R u+w path       ← reset any read-only NTFS files
       rm -rf -- path          ← uses unlinkat(), survives broken NTFS dirents
3. return os.path.exists(path) == False
```

The fallback exists because `ntfs3` can leave directory entries whose
`stat()` returns garbage (`ls -la` shows `-?????????`). Python's
`shutil.rmtree` uses `os.scandir + stat + unlink` and aborts halfway
when it hits one. `rm -rf` ignores stat errors and uses lower-level
syscalls.

If the helper returns False, the operator gets a clear error pointing
to `sudo ntfsfix /dev/nvme0n1p1`.

### 11.2 Copy

`_CopyWorker._copy_file(src, dst)`:

```
part = dst + '.part'
remove any leftover part      ← from a prior aborted run

open(src, 'rb') + open(part, 'wb')
while chunk = src.read(1 MB):
    part.write(chunk)
    progress.emit(bytes_done, total, scan_name)
part.flush()
os.fsync(part.fileno())       ← push pages to device BEFORE close

if getsize(src) != getsize(part):    ← truncation check
    os.remove(part); _skipped += 1; return

copystat(src, part)           ← preserve mtime/perms
os.replace(part, dst)         ← atomic promote
```

After all scans in the batch finish copying:

```
self._current_name = 'flushing to disk…'
os.sync()                     ← global flush — "Copied" only when really on the device
```

`_copytree_bytes` walks with `onerror=self._on_walk_error` so broken
NTFS dirents in subdirectories don't abort the whole scan — they're
just counted.

After each per-scan copy, `_verify_against_source` walks both src and
dst, diffs the relative-path sets, and adds anything in `src - dst`
to `_skipped` and `_missing_names`. Result is reported as
`(N unreadable, M missing in destination)` per scan in the final
dialog.

### 11.3 Orphan recovery

Triggered once at startup by `MainWindow._offer_orphan_recovery`.
`find_orphan_scans` returns folders with `.bag` files but no valid
`scan_info.json`. The dialog shows them as cards; the operator can
mark each one as Recover / Delete / Skip.

**Recover** flows through `_recover_orphan(orphan)`:

```
1. _release_stale_rosbag_locks(folder):
     - killall -TERM rosbag record roslaunch hesai_ros_driver_node \
                            xsens_mti_node seek_driver
       (`record` is the actual recorder binary — `rosbag` is only the
        CLI wrapper; without it a live straggler still holds the
        .bag.active open while we rename it)
     - sleep 0.4 s
     - rename any *.bag.active → *.bag (if .bag doesn't already exist)
2. atomic write of scan_info.json with:
     - parsed site/floor/part from folder name
     - incharge: '(recovered)'
     - started_at: parsed_started_guess
     - stopped_at: orphan['mtime']
     - recovered: True
```

The `recovered: True` flag is later honoured by
`estimate_gb_per_hour` to keep the bogus `stopped_at` from poisoning
the rate average.

---

## 12. Audit log and supervisor PIN

### Audit log

`App/data/action_log.jsonl`. One JSON object per line:

```
{"ts":"2026-05-14T16:17:32","action":"scan_started","details":{"site":"...","folder":"..."}}
{"ts":"2026-05-14T16:32:00","action":"scan_stopped","details":{"folder":"..."}}
{"ts":"2026-05-14T16:48:10","action":"dev_mode_toggled","details":{"new_value":true}}
```

Actions currently logged: `scan_started`, `scan_stopped`, `scans_deleted`,
`copy_completed` / `copy_failed`, `disk_unmounted` /
`disk_unmount_failed`, `dev_mode_toggled`, `device_id_changed`, plus
generic fallbacks from supervisor tools.

Read back via Settings → Supervisor → View Action Log (paginated, 200
entries per page).

### Supervisor PIN

`App/data/supervisor.json`:

```json
{"salt":"<32 hex>", "hash":"<64 hex (pbkdf2_hmac sha256, 100k iters)>"}
```

Default PIN: `0000`. The Settings → Supervisor section nags the user
on first launch to change it.

`is_unlocked()` is true for 10 minutes after a successful PIN entry.
`ensure_unlocked(parent)` is called by every admin tile.

No PIN recovery flow exists. If forgotten, delete `supervisor.json`
on disk and the app falls back to the default PIN.

---

## 13. Theming

`gui/theme.py` defines LIGHT and DARK palettes. The active palette is
selected at import time from `App/data/theme.json` (`{"theme": "dark"}`
or `"light"`).

`gui/main_window.py` re-exports every key from the active palette as a
module constant (`BG`, `PRIMARY`, `TEXT`, …). Everything else imports
from `gui.main_window`, so a theme switch is just "edit theme.json,
restart app."

To add a new theme key:
1. Add it to both LIGHT and DARK in `gui/theme.py`.
2. Add a `KEY = _P['KEY']` line in `gui/main_window.py`.
3. Import and use it wherever needed.

Hot-swap is not supported by design — would require rebuilding every
already-constructed widget for what is effectively a settings-page
preference on a kiosk.

---

## 14. ROS launch file

`~/catkin_hesai_ros2/lidar_imu_record.launch`. Owned by the ROS
workspace, not by this repo, but referenced via `cfg.LAUNCH_FILE`.
Minimal — only the three nodes recording needs:

```xml
<launch>
  <arg name="data_path" default="$(env HOME)/testruns/..."/>

  <node pkg="hesai_ros_driver"  name="hesai_ros_driver_node"
        type="hesai_ros_driver_node"
        launch-prefix="chrt -f 50 taskset -c 1-3"/>

  <node pkg="xsens_mti_driver"  name="xsens_mti_node"
        type="xsens_mti_node"
        launch-prefix="chrt -f 50 taskset -c 0">
      <rosparam command="load" file="$(find xsens_mti_driver)/param/xsens_mti_node.yaml"/>
  </node>

  <node pkg="rosbag" type="record" name="rosbag_record"
        args="--split --duration=30 -b 1024
              -o $(arg data_path)/LITHIC_PRO_V2
              /hesai/pandar /imu/data"/>
</launch>
```

Key things to understand:

- **Real-time priority + core pinning** is on every sensor driver.
  The `chrt -f 50` only takes effect because of the `rtprio 99` limit
  added by `setup-system.sh`.
- **`rosbag record -b 1024`** gives rosbag a 1 GB in-memory buffer so a
  multi-second disk stall (NTFS hiccup) doesn't drop sensor messages.
- **No compression** (`--lz4` / `--bz2` absent) — a truncated compressed
  bag tail is unreadable, an uncompressed one is recoverable via
  `rosbag reindex`.

## 15. Logging — what gets recorded where

| Where | What | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| `/tmp/lithic-app-launch.log` | `run.sh` tee'd output (stdout + stderr) of the entire app launch | Reset on each launch |
| `<scan_folder>/app.log` | `ros.app_log(...)` calls, one per console message + timestamp | Per scan |
| `App/data/action_log.jsonl` | Operator actions (start/stop/delete/copy/admin) | Forever, ~150 bytes/action |
| `~/.ros/log/<uuid>/` | Per-node ROS session logs (roslaunch managed) | Pruned > 7 days via systemd timer |
| `journalctl` | Kernel + systemd-managed services | 200 MB rolling (`SystemMaxUse` from `setup-system.sh`) |
| Bag files | Raw sensor data, named `LITHIC_PRO_V2_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS_<N>.bag` | Forever, until copied/deleted |
| `<scan_folder>/scan_info.json` | Scan metadata (site, floor, part, in-charge, started_at, stopped_at, device) | Forever |

The on-screen console (the QTextEdit at the bottom of the scan player)
shows a filtered subset: only `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `BAG` levels. The
raw `ROS` firehose is dropped from the console but still tee'd to
`<scan_folder>/app.log`.

---

## 16. Operational guide

### Starting the app

- **At boot** (autostart): no action required, just power on. The
  XDG-autostart `.desktop` runs `run.sh`.
- **Manually**: double-click the desktop launcher, or
  `bash run.sh` from a terminal in the app directory.

### Running a scan

1. Home → Start a New Scan (or use the Scan tab in the sidebar).
2. Pick site / floor / part / in-charge. The DeviceStatusPanel on the
   right must show LiDAR + IMU as ready before Start enables.
3. Click Start. The startup-guidance overlay walks through:
   - **45 s STAY STILL** — IMU static-init.
   - **15 s ROTATE — STAY IN PLACE** — rotate device only, don't walk.
   - **5 s START MOVING** — fades out, begin walking.
4. Watch the console for per-bag summary lines and any WARN/ERROR.
5. Click Stop when done. The Stopping… overlay shows for ~5–10 s while
   ROS shuts down, then the player flips to a STOPPED state with
   "Next Scan" available.

### Force-stop everything

If the GUI is unresponsive but you don't want to kill the OS:

```bash
pkill -KILL -f "python3 App/main.py"
pkill -f roslaunch
pkill -f roscore
pkill -f rosmaster
pkill -f xsens_mti_node
pkill -f hesai_ros_driver_node
pkill -x record          # the rosbag recorder binary (-x: exact match)
```

If the entire OS is frozen: the hardware reset button is the only path
(no hardware watchdog is enabled in this build).

### Disable autostart

```bash
mv ~/.config/autostart/INKERS-Data-Collector.desktop{,.disabled}
```

### Copy data off

1. Plug in a USB drive (NTFS or exFAT, ideally ext4-formatted on Linux).
2. Go to Data Transfer. The external drive card should show up within
   ~5 s.
3. Select one or more scans, click Copy to External.
4. Wait for the modal progress dialog to finish. Final dialog reports
   any unreadable / missing files (only happens with corrupted source
   data — see [§11.2](#112-copy)).
5. Click Eject when done; the dialog waits for `udisksctl power-off`
   to return before declaring the drive safe to unplug.

---

## 17. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **App doesn't auto-launch on boot** | Missing/renamed `.desktop` in `~/.config/autostart/` | Re-run `bash install.sh` |
| **Splash screen flashes then disappears** | Python import error before MainWindow | `tail /tmp/lithic-app-launch.log` |
| **LiDAR pill is DEAD even though driver is up** | `rosnode list` slow → 12 s LIVE_TIMEOUT in `_NodeMonitor` | Check `rosnode list` manually; if it hangs, master is stuck |
| **IMU dropping ~50 msgs / 30-s bag** | A second process is reading `/dev/ttyUSB0` | Already fixed via DeviceMonitor.pause(). If recurring, check if `minicom`/`screen` is open |
| **Bag stays at `.bag.active` after Stop** | `roslaunch` was force-killed; rosbag never finalized | App's orphan recovery on next launch will rename + write scan_info.json |
| **`Delete` fails leaving bytes behind** | NTFS metadata corruption on data drive (`ls -la` shows `-?????????`) | App now falls back to `rm -rf`; for the underlying issue, `sudo ntfsfix /dev/nvme0n1p1` |
| **20-min scan crashes the OS** | SD card filled (look at `df /`) | Already prevented: QA terminates below 1.5 GB free. Run cleanup: `sudo apt clean; rm -rf ~/.cache/* ~/.local/share/Trash/*` |
| **`ulimit -r` prints 2, drivers can't get realtime** | rtprio limit not applied | Log out and back in (PAM only reads limits on login). If still 2, check `/etc/security/limits.d/99-lithic-rtprio.conf` |
| **`vcgencmd get_throttled` returns non-zero** | Undervolt / thermal | Better PSU; better cooling. Currently no in-app watchdog for this |
| **Two scans launched in parallel** | Single-instance guard via `QLocalServer` failed (stale socket) | Restart, or `rm /tmp/LithicProV2DataCollector` |

For anything not covered: enable persistent journald (already done by
`setup-system.sh`) and after the next failure:

```bash
# Most recent boot
journalctl -k -b 0 --no-pager | tail -100

# Previous boot (post-crash forensics)
journalctl -k -b -1 --no-pager | tail -100

# What happened to the app process
journalctl _COMM=python3 -b 0 --no-pager
```

---

## 18. Development guide

### Running the app for development

```bash
cd New_Lithic_App
# Optional: enter your venv
source ~/.venvs/inkers/bin/activate
# Source ROS
source ~/catkin_hesai_ros2/devel/setup.bash
# Run directly (skips run.sh's bash plumbing)
python3 App/main.py
```

If you're hacking on the UI and don't have ROS / hardware connected,
set `DEV_MODE = True` in `config.py`. The DeviceMonitor will report all
green, QAWorker will auto-pass, and `_ROSSpinThread` emits mock colored
frames for any `cfg.VIEW_TOPIC`.

### Adding a new ROS driver

1. Add it to `cfg.DRIVERS` with its topic → expected msg-count per 30-s
   bag.
2. Add it to `cfg.DRIVER_NODES` so the LIVE/DEAD pill works.
3. Add a buffer entry to `cfg.BUFFER`.
4. Add a probe to `gui/device_status.py:DeviceMonitor._actually_check`.
5. Add `_DRIVER_LABEL[<key>] = '<display>'` in `core/qa_worker.py`.
6. Update the launch file to include the driver.
7. Make sure the topics are listed in the `rosbag record` args of the
   launch file.

### Adding a new GUI page

1. Create `gui/<your_page>.py` with a `QWidget` subclass.
2. Import + instantiate in `MainWindow._build_content_stack`.
3. Add it to the `items` list in `_build_sidebar` with a glyph + label.
4. Wire any navigation signals via `self._shell.jump_to('<tab>')`.

### Touching `config.py` from the GUI

Use `config.patch_config_py(key, value)`. Adding a new key requires
editing the function to add a regex branch. The patcher is intentionally
keyed to specific names so a typo on the calling side can't blow away
unrelated config.

### Coding conventions

- All imports of theme colors come from `gui.main_window`, NOT from
  `gui.theme` directly, so a theme change is a single import path.
- Long-running blocking work goes in QThread workers or daemon threads,
  never on the Qt event loop.
- Qt cross-thread signal emissions use the default `AutoConnection`,
  which is queued for non-Qt-thread emitters — that's the right
  default in this app. Explicit `QueuedConnection` only where reentrancy
  would matter (e.g. `_ros_stop_done → _finish_stop`).
- Subprocess timeouts everywhere. No `subprocess.run` without a
  `timeout=` keyword. We've been bitten by hung child processes
  blocking the GUI thread.
- No new file should be a `*.md` unless someone explicitly asks for
  documentation. (Self-imposed; reduces drift between code and docs.)

### What NOT to do

- **Don't call `rospy.signal_shutdown()`** between scans. Once tripped,
  rospy is permanently dead in this process — the next `init_node` is
  garbage. `_ROSSpinThread.stop()` only sets a flag; cleanup happens
  through topic unsubscription, not master disconnect.
- **Don't poll the scan folder on a timer.** Every disk read competes
  with rosbag's writes; we observed ~50 IMU messages dropped per 30-s
  bag from a 1-Hz `os.listdir` loop. The inotify path
  (`QFileSystemWatcher`) is mandatory.
- **Don't restrict the GUI's cpuset via `taskset`.** The drivers'
  `launch-prefix=taskset -c 0` inherits the cpuset from the calling
  shell. We learned this the hard way: a `taskset -c 2-3` on the
  Python process made it impossible for xsens to ever land on core 0.
- **Don't write to `App/data/` without an atomic temp + fsync + rename**
  pattern. Power-loss in the middle of writing `supervisor.json` or
  `scan_info.json` would corrupt the file otherwise.

---

## 19. Known design decisions

A few decisions that look weird but are deliberate, in case you're
tempted to "improve" them:

- **The GUI doesn't link rospy/roscpp.** All ROS state lives in
  subprocesses. Easier to reason about, easier to recover when something
  dies. The image-display path is the only place we use rospy at all.
- **roscore is persistent across scans.** Previously we let roslaunch
  spawn its own master and killing roslaunch took it down — the next
  scan would fail because rospy still thought it was talking to the old
  master. Owning roscore ourselves makes "Next Scan" actually work.
- **The bag-rotation log builds its own per-driver block** instead of
  using the `bag_checked` signal from QAWorker. Two readers means two
  rosbag.Bag() opens per close, but it lets us render BAG-level white
  text immediately, while QA still drives terminate decisions
  independently. Single source of truth for the screen, separate one
  for the policy decision.
- **The 5-second `_NodeMonitor` poll interval** is the result of
  measurement, not guessing. At 1-second polling we observed ~50 IMU
  msgs/bag dropped from the rosnode-list subprocess load; at 5 s the
  problem disappears and the operator's "is the driver alive?" feedback
  is still under 6 seconds.
- **`launch()` is asynchronous, guarded by `_launch_gen` + `_llock`,
  not a simpler "disable Stop until launched".** Cold-boot roscore can
  take ~10 s; blocking the GUI for that long looks like a hang, and
  greying out Stop during bring-up would leave the operator with no
  way to abort a launch that's stuck. The generation handshake (every
  worker side effect re-checks the gen inside the lock; `stop()` bumps
  it inside the same lock) means a Stop at ANY point either cleans up
  a completed step or prevents it from happening — no third state.
  `is_running()` deliberately reports True while `_launching` so the
  QA watchdog doesn't misread the bring-up window as a dead roslaunch.
- **`fsync` is mandatory in the copy worker.** We learned the hard way:
  pulling the USB the moment "Copied" was displayed truncated the tail
  of the last bag because the data was still in the kernel's page cache.
- **Recovery rewrites `.bag.active → .bag` rather than running
  `rosbag reindex`.** Reindex requires `rospkg` paths and ROS env
  sourced; renaming is a single syscall. The user can still reindex
  off-device when needed.
- **The supervisor PIN store is intentionally simple.** PBKDF2-SHA256
  with 100k iterations and a per-PIN salt is sufficient for a 4-digit
  PIN on a physical kiosk — the attack model is "a curious operator,"
  not "a remote attacker." Brute-forcing 10⁴ pins still takes a few
  seconds per attempt with the iteration count.

## 20. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Bag** | A rosbag-formatted file (`*.bag`) containing one or more topic recordings. We use `--split --duration=30` so a long scan becomes a sequence of 30-second bags. |
| **`.bag.active`** | An rosbag in flight. Renamed to `.bag` when its 30-second window ends or recording stops. |
| **Driver** | One of `hesai_ros_driver_node`, `xsens_mti_node`, `seek_driver_node`. A ROS node that publishes a topic with raw sensor data. |
| **Drift** | What the IMU shows during the STAY STILL phase. A short static init period gives the IMU a stable bias estimate. |
| **DUMP_PATH** | Root of all scan data. Configurable. `/media/<user>/DATA` on this build. |
| **Orphan scan** | A folder with `.bag` files but no valid `scan_info.json`. Usually the result of a force-killed app. The recovery flow promotes them. |
| **Recovered scan** | A scan whose `scan_info.json` was written by the recovery flow, not by a normal Stop. Flagged with `"recovered": true`. |
| **Scan folder** | The per-scan directory under `<DUMP_PATH>/dumps/<month>/<DD_MMM>/`. Named with site, floor, part, and timestamp. |
| **scan_info.json** | The per-scan metadata file. Written at successful Stop or by orphan recovery. Required for `list_scans` to consider a folder a "scan." |
| **DEV_MODE** | Master switch in `config.py`. When True, hardware is mocked end-to-end so the GUI can run on any machine. Auto-disables QA terminations and replaces sensor probes with mocks. |
